# GOG Galaxy - Community Integration - Python API

This document is still work in progress.

## Basic Usage

Basic implementation:

```python
import sys
from galaxy.api.plugin import Plugin, create_and_run_plugin
from galaxy.api.consts import Platform

class PluginExample(Plugin):
    def __init__(self, reader, writer, token):
        super().__init__(
            Platform.Generic, # Choose platform from available list
            "0.1", # Version
            reader,
            writer,
            token
        )

    # implement methods
    async def authenticate(self, stored_credentials=None):
        pass

def main():
    create_and_run_plugin(PluginExample, sys.argv)

# run plugin event loop
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Plugin should be deployed with manifest:
```json
{
    "name": "Example plugin",
    "platform": "generic",
    "guid": "UNIQUE-GUID",
    "version": "0.1",
    "description": "Example plugin",
    "author": "Name",
    "email": "author@email.com",
    "url": "https://github.com/user/galaxy-plugin-example",
    "script": "plugin.py"
}
```
